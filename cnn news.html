                <p>Hong Kong (CNN)Throughout history, protesters 
                    worldwide have torn down statues of dictators. In Hong Kong, they targeted lamp posts.

                        Two weeks ago, a band of masked protesters dramatically toppled one "smart" sensor-packed lamp post and damaged 19 others -- not in retribution for past oppression, but for fear that it might spy on them in the future.
                        Dystopian uses of "smart" technology are a growing concern in cities around the world. But privacy and anonymity are particular obsessions this summer in Hong Kong. 
                        Facial masks have become the uniform of pro-democracy protesters who have swarmed the streets each weekend since June, and police conceal their faces behind shields and mirrored visors.
                        First sparked by anger over a bill that would allow suspected criminals to be extradited to China, the ongoing protests are now fueled by deepening suspicion of Hong Kong's leaders, whom activists accuse of corroding the semi-autonomous city's freedoms under pressure from Beijing.</p>

                        <p>Washington (CNN)In a previously undisclosed secret mission in 2017, the United States successfully extracted from Russia one of its highest-level covert sources inside the Russian government, multiple Trump administration officials with direct knowledge told CNN.

                                A person directly involved in the discussions said that the removal of the Russian was driven, in part, by concerns that President Donald Trump and his administration repeatedly mishandled classified intelligence and could contribute to exposing the covert source as a spy.
                                The decision to carry out the extraction occurred soon after a May 2017 meeting in the Oval Office in which Trump discussed highly classified intelligence with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and then-Russian Ambassador to the US Sergey Kislyak. The intelligence, concerning ISIS in Syria, had been provided by Israel.

                                                Huffman is scheduled to be sentenced by a judge on Friday. Prosecutors have suggested four months in prison and a $20,000 fine. Her lawyers are asking for a sentence of one year of probation, 250 hours of community service and a $20,000 fine.</p>

                                                <p>The Twitterverse lit up Monday morning over model Chrissy Teigen's response to an attack from President Donald Trump, an exchange that was heated even by the standards of his routine social media fights.

                                                        The spat began when the President, apparently venting about a town hall on criminal justice reform that aired on MSNBC Sunday night, tweeted that he and other Republicans should be getting more credit for signing the First Step Act into law.
                                                        The legislation, signed back in December, includes measures that allow thousands of federal inmates to leave prison earlier than they otherwise would have, eases some mandatory minimum sentences and gives judges more leeway in sentencing, among other things. It had support from lawmakers from both sides of the political aisle and received personal attention from Trump's son-in-law and senior White House adviser Jared Kushner.
                                                        "I SIGNED IT INTO LAW, no one else did, & Republicans deserve much credit. But now that it is passed, people that had virtually nothing to do with it are taking the praise," the President tweeted late Sunday night.
